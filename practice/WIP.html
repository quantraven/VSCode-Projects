        When positions are being bought, the demand for stocks rises.
        This influences other investors to buy. After a few hours, the price plateaus and investors lose their confidence and begin to pull their positions. In fear of a price crash, investors pulling create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

        <br>
        This behavior is an example of psychological biases affecting investment decisions and the financial market.
    <h2>Psychology of Investing</h2>
    <p>Individual investors are prone to bad market timing because of psychological biases.
        Corporate and industrial investors' overconfidence on their models leads to greater risk taking.
        <p>When banks fail, they experience a forced sale or get liquidated like hedge funds. Large commercial banks get bailed out by the government.
